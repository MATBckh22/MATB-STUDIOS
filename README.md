# CS50 Content Page

## Author's Note

[CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/) is a rigorous introduction to computer science with a steep learning curve. For those who don't have the fundamental basics of programming or have little to no experience in coding, I sincerely advise going to [MIT6](https://github.com/MATBckh22/MATB-STUDIOS/blob/5ea3c077cd38b89d2ad7db645db75bc9bbdde76d/README.md) to start off first. That being said, this course covers a lot of content which are beneficial for a novice programmer.

## Prep

Here's a checklist of tasks to prepare before signing up:
- [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- download one or more of the following:
    - [VIM IDE](https://realpython.com/vim-and-python-a-match-made-in-heaven/)
    - *(Used in lecture)* [Spyder IDE](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)

### Regarding CS50 Lectures

Some of the content are repeated in [MIT6](https://github.com/MATBckh22/MATB-STUDIOS/blob/5ea3c077cd38b89d2ad7db645db75bc9bbdde76d/README.md), hence author will skip chapters that are repeated or otherwise better taught in MIT6. Feel free to browse the course website and grab their notes there. Kindly refer to CS50 Updates.
