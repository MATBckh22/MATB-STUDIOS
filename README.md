# Understanding Program Efficiency, Part 2

## Logarithmic Complexity 

Logarithmic complexity refers to growth that grows as log of size of one of it's inputs. 

- bisection search
- binary search

## Bisection Search

A better way to search for particular elements on a list rather than the traditional "walk down" sequential search method:

- pick an index `i` that divides list in half
- ask if `L[i] == e`
- if not, ask if `L[i]` is larger or smaller than `e`
- depending on answer, search to left or right
