# Testing, Debugging, Exceptions, and Assertions

## Defensive Programming

- write specifications for functions
- modularize programs
- check conditions on inputs/outputs

### Testing/Validation

- compare input/output
- *it's not working*
- *how can I break my program?*

### Debugging

- study events that leads up to an error
- *why is it not working?*
- *how can I fix my program?*
