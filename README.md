# C Notes 2

## Operators

## Logical Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Examples |
| - | - | - |
| `&&` | and | `('A' == 'a') && (3 == 3);` evaluates to 0
| `||` | or | `2 == 3 || 'A' == 'a';` evaluates to 1
| `!` | not | `!(3 == 3);` evaluates to 0

### Increment and Decrement Operators

| Normal Arithmetic Expressions | Shortcut |
| - | - |
| `x += 1` | `x++` 
| `x -= 1` | `x--` 
| `y = x; x += 1` | `y = x++`
| `y = x; x -= 1` | `y = x--`

**Note for 3rd and 4th expressions, `x` is evaluated before it is decremented. Switching the positions will also switch their order of evaluation.**

### Assignment Operators 

Common expressions that can be found while programming is of the type:

```
variable = variable (operator) expression
```

C provides compact assignment operators that can be used instead, this is also known as **syntatic sugar**:

```
x += 1 --> x = x + 1
x -= 1 --> x = x - 1
x *= 5 --> x = x * 5
x %= 10 --> x = x % 10
x /= 2 --> x = x / 2
```

### Conditional Expressions

If else blocks can be declared similarly to python:

```C
if (condition){
    expression;
}
else{
    expressions;
}
```

**Using tenary operators to provide syntatic sugar for this particular statement:**

```
variable=(condition)?(expressions if true):(expressions if false)
```

```C
if (x>=0){
    s = 1
}
else{
    x = -1
}

//simplified:

s=x>=0?1:-1
```
