## Evaluating Efficiency

We say that an efficient algorithm consumes acceptable amount of resources in terms of:

- time
- space (memory)

### This part we will be focusing on time efficiency

Challenges in understanding efficiency of a solution to a computational problem:
- a program can be implemented in many different ways
- problem can be solved using only some algorithms 
- separating choices of implementation from choices of more abstract algorithm

## Orders of Growth

We want to achieve these:
- evaluate program efficiency with **very large inputs**
- express **growth of program's run time**
- putting **upper bound** of growth
- emphasizing **order** and **not exact**
- tighting upper bound on growth as function of size of input in worst case

## Asymptotic Analysis



### Measuring Worst Case: Big "Oh" Notation: $O()$

- used to describe worst case:
    - worst case occurs often and is the bottleneck when a program runs
    - express rate of growth of program relative to input size
    - **evaluate algorithm only**

### Measuring Average Case

### Measuring Best Case
