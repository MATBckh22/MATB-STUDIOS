# For Writers

## Welcome to MATB Private Library Writer's Hub 

-----

## Preface

> For students, by students.

**MATB's Private Library is an initiative to provide students a thorough study hub for their courses, giving proper self-study and quick reference resources.**

### Why Github?

Github is an extraodinary platform to facilitate project flow and code editing. For example, [MIT6](https://github.com/MATBckh22/MATB-STUDIOS/blob/d868c24226ffea27bbe3cc0f7250d70be3d729a5/README.md) lecture notes are written entirely through Github using their custom markdowns and third-party libraries. It's a powerful tool that connects the line from a student passively choking on knowledge spoonfed by lecturers to writing a full-fledged tutorial on what the student had learnt.

The library is built essentially to replace your ordinary paper and pen notes, saving time and effort while using more appealing visual aids.

## Rules and Ethics

**MATB strictly follows Github's [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) to provide a friendly user experience while respecting the original author's work.** Building on these foundations, every author and developer in MATB has a few guidelines to adhere:

### When broken, you're banned

- Resources in the library are **completely free**, do not charge fees for any content in the hub. 
    - However, MATB doesn't limit members outside the hub, MATB doesn't account for any liabilities for any transcations made personally.
- **Plagarism is banned here**, *minimal paraphrasing is allowed.* 
    - If the author thinks that the text cannot be explained better, quote using `>` and give the proper reference. (academic referencing of any kind is recommended, otherwise clearly state your reference in your own words)
    - **Do not include problems in academic exams, quizzes, finals that are from your local institute in your notes. Tutorials, exercises and projects that your instrutor, lecturer or professor didn't assert it's confidentiality are allowed.**
    - MATB cannot allow posting links or files with pirated content.
- **Do not post NSFW, gore, violence, provocative, sexual-hints, insulting or inappropriate content.**
    - This also includes, but not limited to showing discrimination, harrassment and gaslighting political views and prejudices. **Keep your dank political humor to yourself.**
- Unsolicited advertising, spamming and text flooding are red flags here.
- **Do not cheat on tests and exams.** Do not be academically dishonest. Do not offer money for doing homework assignments, and vice-versa.
- Do not publish or include people's private information without their consent. 

**In general, apply common sense and be respectful, your main audience is people who are interested but are gatekeeped outside the walls of academics. You're a guide, not an egotistic show-off.**

### Follow this and you're cool

- **Respect topics in the same section, double check that you're writing in the right place.**
- **Write from the perspective of a learner, avoid shortforms, slangs.** You're writing open-source notes that are being shown in public, write and format in your own style but consider that it's human-readable.
- Feel free to include your social media, but avoid giving out your personal details in the hub.
