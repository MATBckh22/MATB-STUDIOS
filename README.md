## Branching and Iteration
#STRINGS
enclosed in quotation marks or single quotes, exp
hi = "hello there"

notice " " is defined as space, exp
name = ABC
greeting = hi + " " + name
print(greeting)

Difference in printing , and + between objects
```
>>> print("hi","chong")
hi chong
>>> print("hi"+"chong")
hichong
```

# INPUT: input("")
prints whatever is in the quotes, the string user types next will be binded as a variable (input into memory), exp:
```
>>> text = input("type something down below")
type something down below
hello
>>> print(text)
hello
```
# Cast: input for numbers
binding numbers (only when ur working with numbers)
```
>>> num = int(input("type a number"))
type a number25
>>> print(5*num)
125
```
# Comparisons
only variables, evaluate to a boolean
```
i > j
i >= j
i < j
i <= j
i == j  equality test, True if i is the same as j
i != j  inequality test, True if i not the same as j
```
test:
```
>>> i = 5
>>> j = 6
>>> i<j
True
>>> i>j
False
```
# Logic Variables
Note: may take some time to understand this

boolean values: table refer to slide 8, comparison example below
```
pset_time = 15
sleep_time = 8
print(sleep_time > pset_time)
derive = True
drink = False
both = drink and derive
print(both)
```
# if else vs elif else (Control Flow and Branching)
```
if <condition>:
<expression>
<expression>
...
else:
<expression>
<expression>
```
decision is made from the condition under if that is true or false, expressions is evaluated or executed when condition is true
(but it will be weird)

```
if <condition>:
<expression>
<expression>
...
elif <condition>:
<expression>
<expression>
...
else:
<expression>
<expression>
```
elif is made for a separate condition if the first condition is not true, if all is false, the last expression under *else* is executed

*see how multiple conditions can have shorter strings of code using elif vs if*

if else only
```
x = float(input("type a number to compare"))
y = float(input("type another number to compare"))
if x > y:
    print("x is bigger")
    print("y is smaller")
if y > x:
    print("y is bigger")
    print("x is smaller")
if x == y:
    print("they're the same!")
```

elif
```
x = float(input("type a number to compare"))
y = float(input("type another number to compare"))
if x > y:
    print("x is bigger")
    print("y is smaller")
elif y > x:
        print("y is bigger")
        print("x is smaller")
else:
        print("they're the same!")
```

# WHILE loops
if else infinite loop can be turned into while loops 
```
while <condition>:
  <expression>
<expression>
```
<condition> evaluates to a Boolean. If <condition> is True, do all the steps inside the while code block. Check <condition> again, repeat until <condition> is False.

# FOR loops
act as a n=n+1 loop shortcut, while vs foor below:
```
n = 0
while n < 5:
print(n)
n = n+1
```

for loop shortcut
```
for n in range(5):
print(n)
```
Each time through the loop, <variable> takes a value, first time, <variable> starts at the smallest value, next time, <variable> gets the prev value + 1
etc. **range() creates a sequence from 0 to whatever number u set, in this case it's 0-5**

#Controlling range() 
range(start, stop, step), default: start = 0, step = 1
```
mysum = 0
for i in range(7, 10):
mysum += i
print(mysum)

mysum = 0
for i in range(5, 11, 2):
mysum += i
print(mysum)
```
*note: doesn't include stop values*

# Break
break acts as an immediate exit from the while loop when a condition is met and skips the remaining expressions after, but only exits it's innermost loop.
```
while <condition_1>:
  while <condition_2>:
    <expression_a>
    break
        <expression_b>
    <expression_c>
```
example below:
```
mysum = 0
for i in range(5, 11, 2):
    mysum += i
    if mysum == 5:
      break
    mysum += 1
print(mysum)
```
